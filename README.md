## Products_cr (*CR stands for Create and Read, since the app doesn't include the full CRUD cycle)

This is a Django-based web application that provides an API for managing products.
The application allows users to add products via a form, view a list of products,
and interact with the API endpoints for product creation and retrieval.

### Features
- Product Management: Add, view, and manage products with name, description, and price fields.
- API Endpoints:
  - GET /api/products/: Retrieve the list of products.
  - POST /api/products/: Create a new product.
- Client-side Form Validation: Simple validation for product name and price.
- Dynamic Frontend: Uses JavaScript to dynamically display the list of products and handle form submissions.
